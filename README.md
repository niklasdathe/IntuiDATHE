# IntuiDATHE

**IntuiDATHE** (Intuitive Digital Lathe) will be an open-source project aimed at unifying CAM and CNC control into a single, seamless application. By merging the standalone **IntuiCAM** (CAM software with 3D viewer and toolpath generation) and **IntuiGUI** (QtVCP-based LinuxCNC interface), IntuiDATHE will empower CNC operators with an integrated workflow: from CAD import to toolpath generation and machine executionâ€”without ever leaving the GUI.
